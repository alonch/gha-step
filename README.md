# GitHub Action Steps with Matrix

This action allows you to run steps in parallel using a matrix strategy, similar to GitHub Actions matrix jobs but within a single job. It also supports passing outputs between steps and collecting results from all matrix combinations.

## Features

- Run steps in parallel using matrix combinations
- Powerful matrix include system for extending and customizing combinations
- Conditional matrix value additions based on existing combinations
- Create standalone matrix entries for special cases
- Pass outputs between steps
- Access matrix values as environment variables
- Collect and combine outputs from all matrix executions

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: alonch/gha-steps@main
  id: gha-steps
  with:
    matrix: |
      - os: [ubuntu, macos]
        version: [20.04, 22.04]
    outputs: |
      - results: ${ STEPS_TEST_RESULT }
    steps: |
      - name: build
        id: build
        run: |
          echo "artifact=${ MATRIX_OS }-${ MATRIX_VERSION }" >> $STEPS_OUTPUTS
      - name: test
        id: test
        run: |
          echo "testing ${ STEPS_BUILD_ARTIFACT }"
          echo "result=OK" >> $STEPS_OUTPUTS
```
**Output**

```json
[
  {"result":"OK","os":"ubuntu","version":"20.04"},
  {"result":"OK","os":"ubuntu","version":"22.04"},
  {"result":"OK","os":"macos","version":"20.04"},
  {"result":"OK","os":"macos","version":"22.04"}
]
```

## Inputs

| Input        | Description                                                                | Required | Default |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| matrix       | Matrix configuration in YAML format defining parallel execution combinations | Yes      | -        |
| steps        | List of steps to execute sequentially for each matrix combination          | Yes      | -        |
| outputs      | List of outputs to collect from steps                                      | Yes      | -        |
| max-parallel | Maximum number of matrix combinations to run in parallel                    | No       | âˆž        |

### matrix
Matrix configuration in YAML format. Each key-value pair becomes an environment variable with the `MATRIX_` prefix.

Example:
```yaml
- os: [ubuntu, macos]
  version: [20.04, 22.04]
```

#### Matrix Include
Use `include` to expand existing matrix configurations or add new combinations. The value of `include` is a list of objects that follows these rules:

1. For each object in the include list:
   - Key-value pairs are added to each matrix combination if they don't overwrite existing values
   - If an object can't be added to any existing combination without overwriting values, it creates a new combination
   - Original matrix values are preserved, but added values can be overwritten by subsequent includes

Example with includes:
```yaml
matrix: |
  - os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest]
    node: [14, 16]
    include:
      - color: green          # Added to all combinations
      - os: windows-latest    # Adds npm only to windows + node 16
        node: 16
        npm: 6
      - os: macos            # Creates new standalone combination
        node: 18
```

This results in:
```json
[
  {"os": "windows-latest", "node": "14", "color": "green"},
  {"os": "windows-latest", "node": "16", "npm": "6", "color": "green"},
  {"os": "ubuntu-latest", "node": "14", "color": "green"},
  {"os": "ubuntu-latest", "node": "16", "color": "green"},
  {"os": "macos", "node": "18"}
]
```

### steps
List of steps to execute. Each step must have:
- `name`: Step display name
- `id`: Unique identifier for the step
- `run`: Shell commands to execute

Example:
```yaml
- name: Build
  id: build
  run: echo "artifact=example" >> $STEPS_OUTPUTS
```

### outputs
List of outputs to collect from all matrix executions.

Example:
```yaml
- result: ${ STEPS_TEST_RESULT }
  artifact: ${ STEPS_BUILD_ARTIFACT }
```

## Environment Variables

- `MATRIX_*`: Matrix values are available as environment variables with the `MATRIX_` prefix (uppercase)
- `STEPS_*`: Step outputs are available as environment variables with the format `STEPS_<STEP_ID>_<OUTPUT_NAME>` (uppercase)
- `STEPS_OUTPUTS`: Special file path where steps can write their outputs

## Outputs

| Output    | Description                                                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| json      | JSON array containing results from all matrix combinations                |
| outcome   | Overall execution status: 'success', 'failure', or 'cancelled'           |

### json
Contains an array of objects, each representing a matrix combination execution with:
- All matrix values used (e.g., os, version)
- All collected outputs specified in the `outputs` input
- Execution status and details

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "version": "20.04",
    "result": "OK",
    "artifact": "ubuntu-20.04"
  }
]
```

### outcome
Indicates the overall execution status:
- `success`: All matrix combinations completed successfully
- `failure`: One or more combinations failed
- `cancelled`: The workflow was cancelled during execution
